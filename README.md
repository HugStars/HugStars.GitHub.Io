###🍒Personal introduction:

You have to endure, endure until spring flowers bloom;
You have to go until the lights are bright;
You have to see the vast world and judge whether it is good or bad;
You have to be strong enough to get better, and then stand beside people you can't imagine;
If you want to be what you think you are, you can't let it happen at all.
