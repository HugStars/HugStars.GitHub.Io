      <section>
        You have to endure, endure until spring flowers bloom;
        <br>
        You have to go until the lights are bright;
        <br>
        You have to see the vast world and judge whether it is good or bad;
        <br>
        You have to be strong enough to get better, and then stand beside people you can't imagine;
        <br>
        If you want to be what you think you are, you can't let it happen at all.
